  abstract = {Sand dunes are important geomorphic formations of coastal ecosystems that are critical in protecting human populations that live in coastal areas. Dune formation is driven by ecomorphodynamic interactions between vegetation and sediment deposition. While there has been extensive research on responses of dune grasses to sand burial, there is a knowledge gap in understanding mechanisms of acclimation between similar, coexistent, dune-building grasses such as Ammophila breviligulata (C3), Spartina patens (C4), and Uniola paniculata (C4). Our goal was to determine how physiological mechanisms of acclimation to sand burial vary between species. We hypothesize that (1) in the presence of burial, resource allocation will be predicated on photosynthetic pathway and that we will be able to characterize the C3 species as a root allocator and the C4 species as leaf allocators. We also hypothesize that (2) despite similarities between these species in habitat, growth form, and life history, leaf, root, and whole plant traits will vary between species when burial is not present. Furthermore, when burial is present, the existing variability in physiological strategy will drive species-specific mechanisms of survival. In a greenhouse experiment, we exposed three dune grass species to different burial treatments: 0 cm (control) and a one-time 25-cm burial to mimic sediment deposition during a storm. At the conclusion of our study, we collected a suite of physiological and morphological functional traits. Results showed that Ammophila decreased allocation to aboveground biomass to maintain root biomass, preserving photosynthesis by allocating nitrogen (N) into light-exposed leaves. Conversely, Uniola and Spartina decreased allocation to belowground production to increase elongation and maintain aboveground biomass. Interestingly, we found that species were functionally distinct when burial was absent; however, all species became more similar when treated with burial. In the presence of burial, species utilized functional traits of rapid growth strategy, although mechanisms of change were interspecifically variable.},

Woody plants are buried on open coastal dunes and in forested areas behind active blowouts; however, little is known about the burial responses and adaptive traits of these species. The objectives of this study were: (a) to determine the growth and morphological responses to burial in sand of seven woody plant species native to central Canadian coastal dunes; and (b) to identify traits that determine burial tolerance in these species., \textbullet{} Methods Field experiments were conducted to determine the responses of each species to burial. Saplings were exposed to burial treatments of 0, 10, 25, 50 and 75\,\% of their height. Burial responses were evaluated based on regressions of total biomass, height, adventitious root production and percentage allocation to shoot, root and adventitious root biomass on percentage burial., \textbullet{} Key Results Pinus strobus and Picea glauca lacked burial tolerance. In response to the burial gradient, these species showed a strong linear decline in total biomass, minimal adventitious root production that peaked at moderate levels (25\textendash 50\,\% burial) and no change in allocation to shoots vs. roots. The tolerant species Juniperus virginiana, Thuja occidentalis and Picea mariana showed a quadratic response to burial, with little change in biomass up to 50\,\% burial, but a large decline at 75\,\%. These species produced abundant adventitious roots up to 50\,\% burial, but did not alter allocation patterns over the range of burial levels. Populus balsamifera and Salix cordata were stimulated by burial. These species showed linear increases in biomass with increasing burial, produced copious adventitious roots across the gradient and showed a clear shift in allocation to vertical shoot growth and adventitious root production at the expense of the original roots under high burial conditions., \textbullet{} Conclusions Adventitious root production and plastic resource allocation to biomass are adaptive traits of coastal dune woody plants in central Canada, and provide a basis for assessing burial tolerance in woody plants on coastal dunes throughout the world.},

An assessment was made of whether these clonal herbs of similar morphology but from contrasting habitats show different foraging behaviour for light. In a garden experiment, the plants wer subjected to four levels of light availability, and to a split treatment in which the primary stolons grew along the border of patches of the two intermediate light levels. In this treatment the plant parts on opposite sides of the primary stolons were in contrasting light environments. Petiole extension was more responsive to light conditions in Hydrocotyle than in Lamiastrum, while the opposite was true for leaf area. Both species showed similar responses in stolon internode length and specific leaf area (SLA). Integration did not significantly modify local responses in stolon internode length in either species. Local responses in petiole length, leaf area and SLA of Hydrocotyle ramets were not significantly affected by physiological integration, except for the SLA of ramets in high light which was evened out by integration. In contrast, in Lamiastrum, local responses in petiole length, leaf area and SLA of many ramets in the shaded and/or light patch were significantly evened out by integration. As a result, interconnected ramets in patches of different light supply developed very different morphologies in Hydrocotyle, but not in Lamiastrum. The results indicate that the species differed in ramet morphological responses to light intensity as well as in effects of integration on local morphological responses, and suggest that species from different habitats show different foraging behaviour for light.},

  abstract = {Salt spray mainly originates from the bursting of bubbles in breaking waves and is often considered as one of the dominant factors contributing to vegetation zonation in coastal dunes. In this paper, the literature on salt spray distribution and impact on dune plants are reviewed. Salt spray distribution is greatly affected by wave energy, wind conditions, distance from the coast, topography, vegetation, precipitation, and sand/soil properties. The amount of salt accumulation and trapping efficiency of the vegetative canopy are largely dependent on the plant characteristics such as architecture and leaf morphology. Salt concentrations in sand mainly vary with soil texture. Salt spray has negative impacts on plant growth and can cause water stress, promote tissue necrosis and leaf loss, reduce stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, photosynthesis, affect assimilates, or hormone supply to the growing organs. Damage to plants is increased by sand and wind abrasion and insect damage on leaves. High humidity, dew formation, light drizzle, and fog increase the rates of salt uptake by plant leaves. Plant seedlings and reproductive organs are more significantly affected by salt spray compared with mature plants and plant leaves respectively. Salt spray can also provide nutrition to plants particularly in coastal dunes with lower soil nutrition and salt accumulation rates. Species near the sea often show phenological, morphological, and physiological adaptations to salt spray including dormant times/seasons, low heights, compacted and asymmetrical canopies, unique leaf morphologies and/or orientations, dense hairs, rigid cuticles, and closed stomata. Surfactants produced from human activities can aggravate the damage on plants at average salt spray levels. Methods to trap salt vary considerably in the literature, and results from different studies may not be comparable due to trap type, placement, and landscape position. Greenhouse versus field experiments and sampling may not always be compatible. The relations between salt spray distribution and vegetation zonation will be further complicated under climate change and human activities.},

  abstract = {Within a physiologically integrated clone, the structure and functioning of an individual ramet is determined by: 1) the response of that ramet to its local environment and 2) its response to resource integration within the clone. In a multifactorial experiment, Hydrocotyle bonariensis ramets were grown in limiting resource environments with and without the benefit of basipetal resource movement from another branch of the clone. Ramets were analyzed for their morphological responses to variation in local light, water and nitrogen availability and to the superimposed effect of resource integration on these conditions. The expression of ramet morphology, from induction to development, was highly plastic in response to variable local resource availability. Resource integration changed a ramet's local response in a variety of ways depending on the resource(s) being translocated and the character involved. Among leaf characteristics (leaf weight, petiole height, blade area), resource translocation into the shade resulted in an enhancement of the local response. Similarly, the translocation of nitrogen and water generally increased clonal proliferation and sexual reproduction among ramets. In contrast, the translocation of water reversed the effect of local low water conditions on ramets by inhibiting root production. Some characters such as internode distance and leaf allometry were unaffected by integration. The maintenance of connections between ramets as a Hydrocotyle clone expands allows for resource sharing among widely separated ramets and can result in an integrated morpological response to a resource environment that is patchy in time and space.},

In order to study this development, a spatially explicit model of sand dune plant succession on Galveston Island, Texas, was created, using sea-level rise as the primary mechanism causing local erosion. Simulations of sea-level rise scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change demonstrated that beach erosion constrained plants to a narrow area, resulting in a breakdown of the successional process. The loss of late-succession plants along coastlines, their dependent faunal species, and possible solutions are discussed. This model and example serves as a harbinger of the future for many of the US's sandy beaches and coastal communities.},

Does disturbance increase or decrease environmental stress at local scale? Location: The Atlantic coastal dune system of the Aquitaine Region (France). Methods: Species biomass and 16 environmental variables were sampled in 128 quadrats along a local beach-inland gradient and a regional North-South gradient. Environmental data were analysed with ANOVAs and vegetation-environment relationships with Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Results: At the local scale community composition was primarily driven by disturbance due to sand burial, whereas water and nutrient stress better explained regional differences. However, random biogeographical events are very likely to also affect community composition at the largest scale. The main interaction between environmental stress and disturbance was the mitigation of nutrient stress induced by disturbance at a local scale. This was due to a positive direct effect of sand burial and a positive indirect effect of wind (decrease in VPD by ocean spray). Although wind had also a significant effect on soil conductivity and pH, there was no evidence that these factors had any role in community composition. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that disturbance had a primary role at local scale and environmental stress at regional scale but further research is needed to separate the effect of stress from that of dispersal at regional scale. We also demonstrated that environmental stress in primary succession may not always decline with decreasing disturbance.},

We manipulated plant density, species diversity (richness), and a burial disturbance in a controlled, complete factorial experiment to test theories about the relationships among species interactions, disturbance, and richness. The hypotheses tested were 1) burial disturbance reduces plant performance at all levels of density and richness, 2) burial disturbance can cause net plant interactions to become more facilitative, and 3) facilitation increases with species richness. Burial decreased plant survival by 60\% and biomass by 50\%, supporting the hypothesis that burial reduces plant performance. In the control (unburied) treatment, there was no difference in proportion survival or per plant biomass between low and high density plots, meaning that neither competition nor facilitation was detected. In the buried treatment, however, high density plots had significantly greater survival and greater per plant biomass than the low density plots, indicating net facilitative interactions. Thus facilitation occurred in the buried treatment and not in the unburied control plots, supporting the hypothesis that facilitation increases with increasing disturbance severity. The hypothesis that facilitation increases with increasing species richness was not supported. Richness did not affect survival or biomass, and there was no richness by burial treatment interaction, indicating that richness did not influence the response of the community to burial. The influence of the disturbance on plant interactions was thus consistent across levels of richness, increasing the generality of the relationship between disturbance and facilitation.},

  abstract = {Coastal dune plants are subjected to natural multiple stresses and vulnerable to global change. Some changes associated with global change could interact in their effects on vegetation. As vegetation plays a fundamental role in building and stabilizing dune systems, effective coastal habitat management requires a better understanding of the combined effects of such changes on plant populations. A manipulative experiment was conducted along a Mediterranean dune system to examine the individual and combined effects of increased sediment accretion (burial) and nitrogen enrichment associated with predicted global change on the performance of young clones of Sporobolus virginicus, a widespread dune stabilizing species. Increased burial severity resulted in the production of taller but thinner shoots, while nutrient enrichment stimulated rhizome production. Nutrient enrichment increased total plant biomass up to moderate burial levels (50\% of plant height), but it had not effect at the highest burial level (100\% of plant height). The effects of such factors on total biomass, shoot biomass and branching were influenced by spatial variation in natural factors at the scale of hundreds of metres. These results indicate that the effects of burial and nutrient enrichment on plant performance were not independent. Their combined effects may not be predicted by knowing the individual effects, at least under the study conditions. Under global change scenarios, increased nutrient input could alleviate nutrient stress in S. virginicus, enhancing clonal expansion and productivity, but this benefit could be offset by increased sand accretion levels equal or exceeding 100\% of plant height. Depletion of stored reserves for emerging from sand could increase plant vulnerability to other stresses in the long-term. The results emphasize the need to incorporate statistical designs for detecting non-independent effects of multiple changes and adequate spatial replication in future works to anticipate the impact of global change on dune ecosystem functioning.},

Given the importance of these two factors, there is a surprising lack of field investigations of the interactions between burial and nutrient availability. This study aims to address this issue by measuring the growth responses of four coastal dune plant species to these two factors and their interaction. Species that naturally experience either high or low rates of burial were selected and a factorial burial by nutrient addition experiment was conducted. Growth characteristics were measured in order to determine which characteristics allow a species to respond to burial. Species that naturally experience high rates of burial (Arctotheca populifolia and Scaevola plumieri) displayed increased growth when buried, and this response was nutrient- limited. Stable-dune species had either small (Myrica cordifolia, N-fixer) or negligible responses to burial (Metalasia muricata), and were not nutrient-limited. This interspecific difference in response to burial and/or fertiliser is consistent with the idea that burial maintains the observed zonation of species on coastal dunes. Species that are unable to respond to burial are prevented from occupying the mobile dunes. Species able to cope with high rates of burial had high nitrogen-use efficiencies and low dry mass costs of production, explaining their ability to respond to burial under nutrient limitation. The interaction between burial and nutrient limitation is understudied but vital to understanding the zonation of coastal dune plant species.},

Flooding and coastal erosion pose a serious threat to these environments, a situation likely to be exacerbated by factors associated with climate change. Despite their importance, these sandy `soft' defences have been lost from many European coasts through the proliferation of coastal development and associated hard-engineering and face further losses due to sea-level rise, subsidence, storm surge events, and coastal squeeze. As part of the EU-funded THESEUS project we investigated the critical drivers that determine the persistence and maintenance of sandy coastal habitats around Europe's coastline, taking particular interest in their close link with the biological communities that inhabit them. The successful management of sandy beaches to restore and sustain sand budgets (e.g. via nourishment), depends on the kind of mitigation undertaken, local beach characteristics, and on the source of `borrowed' sediment. We found that inter-tidal invertebrates were good indicators of changes linked to different mitigation options. For sand dunes, field observations and manipulative experiments investigated different approaches to create new dune systems, in addition to measures employed to improve dune stabilisation. THESEUS provides a `toolbox' of management strategies to aid the management, restoration, and creation of sandy habitats along our coastlines, but we note that future management must consider the connectivity of sub-littoral and supra-littoral sandy habitats in order to use this natural shoreline defence more effectively.},

  abstract = {Barrier islands are at the forefront of storms and sea-level rise. High disturbance regimes and sediment mobility make these systems sensitive and dynamic. Island foredunes are protective structures against storm-induced overwash that are integrally tied to dune grasses via biogeomorphic feedbacks. Shifts in dune grass dominance could influence dune morphology and susceptibility to overwash, altering island stability. In a glasshouse study, two dune grasses, Ammophila breviligulata and Uniola paniculata, were planted together and subjected to a 20~cm burial to quantify morphological and physiological responses. Burial had positive effects on both plants as indicated by increased electron transport rate and total biomass. Ammophila breviligulata performance declined when planted with U. paniculata. Uniola paniculata was not affected when planted with A. breviligulata but did have higher water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency. Planted in mixture, differential reallocation of biomass occurred between species potentially altering resource acquisition further. As U. paniculata migrates into A. breviligulata dominated habitat and A. breviligulata performance diminishes, biotic interactions between these and other species may affect dune formation and community structure. Our study emphasizes the importance of studying biotic interactions alongside naturally occurring abiotic drivers.},

  abstract = {1. The modules of plants experience different levels of resources, and clonal plants can integrate resource heterogeneity. However, no studies have tested whether the benefits of clonal integration depend on patterns of heterogeneity in multiple resources, like high levels of above-ground and below-ground resources in the same patches (`coincident patchiness') or different patches (`reciprocal patchiness'). 2. We hypothesized that the benefits of clonal integration can vary depending on whether patchiness is reciprocal or coincident, and that clonal species experience greater benefits from integration when qualitative patterns of resource heterogeneity are more like those likely to occur in their habitats. To test these hypotheses, we grew pairs of connected ramets of Cynodon dactylon and Potentilla reptans under high and low levels of light and of water and soil nutrients, and measured the growth and physiological traits of the plants. 3. Consistent with the hypotheses, connection between ramets in contrasting patches increased final dry mass of Cynodon by 30\% compared with connection between ramets within the same type of patch when resource patchiness was coincident, whereas connection decreased mass by 60\% when patchiness was reciprocal. Inconsistent with the hypotheses, between-patch connection increased mass of Potentilla by 70\% over within-patch connection whether patchiness was reciprocal or coincident; although the species did grow accumulate more mass when patchiness was reciprocal. 4. In Cynodon, treatments had little effect on allocation of mass to roots or specific leaf area; analysis of mass of ramets within pairs suggested that constraints on translocation may have underlain differential effects of reciprocal and coincident patchiness on performance. In Potentilla, treatments affected all measured characteristics, suggesting a higher degree of clonal integration that may have allowed clones to benefit strongly from integration regardless of pattern of resource patchiness. 5. Synthesis. The ability of some plant species to benefit from clonal integration can depend strongly on whether resource heterogeneity is coincident or reciprocal, while other species may benefit equally from integration under both resource patterns. Our results provide an initial indication that the ecological range of some clonal species may be linked to patterns of resource patchiness via traits of clonal integration.},

In this study, flow over scarps (also termed forward-facing steps) is reviewed, and the flow over a vertical scarp (90\textdegree ) and three slopes of 45\textdegree, 24\textdegree, and 14\textdegree, all 2 m in height, is examined via CFD modelling. The flow over three 90\textdegree{} scarps, with heights of 1 m, 2 m and 4 m, and over a 2-m high vertical (90\textdegree ) scarp for three oblique incident winds is studied. The extent of wind flow deceleration and separation becomes smaller with decreased slope, with maximum flow separation and reverse vortex development occurring on the vertical scarp. The extent of crest wind flow separation is greatest for the scarp and considerably less for the 45\textdegree{} slope. As scarp height increases, so too does the spatial extent of turbulent wind flow, wind speed, and extent of the flow separation region. As incident wind direction became more oblique over a vertical scarp, less deceleration occurs, and helicoidal vortices replace roller vortices. Our results demonstrate how scarp morphology and wind direction are likely to influence transport pathways.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the stresses on coastal plants and plant adaptations imposed in the coastal dune environment. The coastal dune ecosystem experiences severe stresses in the form of salt spray, sand burial, swash inundation, dryness, high light intensity, wind exposure, soil salinity and nutrient deficiency. Common adaptations to these stresses include salt resistance, positive growth response to burial, flooding resistance, leaf roll, photosynthesis, salt bladders, nitrogen fixation, variation of life cycle, germination strategies, and plant morphology to name a few. The level of these stresses is highest in the beach\textendash foredune environment and generally decreases with distance from the coast in fully vegetated coastal dune systems (e.g. relict foredune plains). Plant succession and generally species richness tend to follow these landward-decreasing trends. Blowouts disrupt the most simple systems. Parabolic dunes, when active, display reversed-succession landward trends compared to foredunes and locally disjunct lateral species patterns. Transgressive (mobile) dunefields experience high stress levels (principally a mobile substrate) and locally, slack and deflation basins add cement pavement or standing water stresses. Microenvironments and local habitats are generally lowest on foredunes, moderate on blowouts and parabolics, and highest on transgressive dunefields. On a global scale, warm temperature coasts generally display the highest species richness, lowest stress levels overall, and possibly lowest number of endemic species. As semi-aridity and aridity on coasts increase, there is a trend towards increasing stress levels, lower species richness (particularly in foredunes), less foredune, relict foredune and parabolic dune development, increasing development of transgressive dunefields, less plant cover, more endemic species, and an increasing mixture of desert and coastal species. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Derek Ranwell.},

Vegetation cover, morphology, growth rates, and types combine with aerodynamic processes to determine dune and swale morphology. Established foredunes are classified into five morpho-ecological types, and the flow behaviour over two types is detailed.

Four types of incipient foredunes may be distinguished, namely: type 1, those initiated by shadow dune formation within zones of discrete individual pioneer annuals (e.g. Cakile spp.), and perennials (e.g. Spinifex spp.; Ammophila spp.); type 2, those initiated by dunelet or hummock formation within discrete colonies of perennial grasses and herbs; type 3, those initiated by sand deposition within laterally extensive colonies of pioneer seedlings; and type 4, those initiated by sand deposition within a laterally extensive plant rhizome cover.Type 1 dunes are dominated by high, local flow deceleration and 3-D flow separation. Shadow dunes form within and downwind of the discrete plants. If colonised by annual plants, invasion by perennial plants is necessary for survival. Later lateral plant spread and accretion produces hummocky terraces and ridges. Type 2 dunes (dunelets) are characterised by local landward flow deceleration and marginal high velocity side flows. Sand deposition results in the formation of low, discrete, semi-circular convex mounds (seedlings), or more elongate hummocks and mounds (rhizomes). Types 3 and 4 dunes are characterised by laterally extensive, often homogeneous vegetation canopies. High canopies display more rapid landward flow deceleration than low canopies, thus narrow, asymmetric ridges and longer convex ridges result respectively. High plant densities result in rapid down-canopy flow deceleration, maximum traction load retardation and the formation of narrow asymmetric ridges. Dune height decreases and dune length increases as plant densities decrease. Maximum deposition zones occur for each wind velocity range. Whether ramp, terrace or ridge morphologies are formed depends on mode of beach colonisation, plant density and distribution, sand volume, wind speed, and plant species type and morphology.A range of variables which affect foredune morphology and evolution, including plant canopy density, height and distribution, wind velocity, and various ecological environmental processes are examined.},

  abstract = {Coastal dunes form in many parts of the world the first flood defense line against the sea. To study effects of climate change on coastal dune evolution, we used a cellular model of dune, beach, and vegetation development. The model was calibrated and validated against field measurements of the Dutch coast, showing good performance for 10 year simulations. A sensitivity analysis showed that dune size and morphology are most sensitive to the rate of aeolian input and wave dissipation. Finally, 100 year climate change scenarios were run to establish the impacts of sea level rise and changes in vegetation growth rate on dune evolution. The results are in good agreement with conceptual models of dune evolution. Sea level rise largely determines the direction of dune evolution: the rate of rising controls whether dunes are able to preserve their height or sand volume while migrating landward. The effect of changing vegetation growth rates, resulting from climate change, is most manifest in dune response to large disturbances. If vegetation is removed halfway into the simulation, vegetation growth rate determines whether a foredune will revegetate and recover its height. Low vegetation growth rates result in mobile dunes that lose sand. The good agreement between observations and predictions indicates that the model successfully incorporates the suite of biogeomorphic and marine processes involved in dune building.},

Further, how clonal shrubs adapt to dune environments is unknown. In this study, we test the hypotheses that oriented-growth and patchiness are adaptive strategies of clonal shrubs to dune environments, while wind erosion and sand burial are the driving factors. We sampled 250 rhizomatous fragments to assess oriented-growth of Calligonum arborescens, and investigated the distribution (east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, north and northeast) of C. arborescens in four different habitats of active dunes: inter-dune areas, windward slope, leeward slope, and the top of dune. We found that most of the fragments of C. arborescens grew in the northeastern and southwestern directions. Ramet number and biomass, and rhizome length and biomass in these two directions were significantly higher than those found in other directions. Interestingly, these directions were perpendicular to the direction of prevailing winds. Distribution of C. arborescens differed among habitats. Total number of individuals was significantly higher in inter-dune areas and on windward slopes than on top and leeward slopes of dunes; more clonal ramets were produced on top of dunes than elsewhere, and only 16.7\% were found on leeward slopes. Both sand-burial and wind erosion affected the growth and regeneration of C. arborescens. Ramet number and biomass production decreased with increasing depth of burial and severity of erosion, but increased in moderate erosion treatments. We conclude that fragments of C. arborescens exhibited oriented-growth; most of the rhizomes grew in the direction perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction. Most of C. arborescens were found in inter-dune lands and on windward slopes. C. arborescens was well established in active dune fields through both vegetative propagation and sexual reproduction. Sand-burial and wind erosion were the key factors which led to the oriented-growth and patchiness of C. arborescens.},

  abstract = {Coastal dunes have a worldwide distribution and are comprised of a variety of forms going through successional changes in geomorphology and ecological association. Some changes are driven by natural processes whereas other changes are products of human endeavors. Coastal dunes are highly valuable multifunctional ecosystems that occupy a unique natural niche.Further, these same systems are ideal locations for recreation, replenishment of local aquifers, and coastal defense (van der Meulen et al., Chap. 16, this Vol.).However, in spite of their many valuable attributes, these ecosystems share a history of exploitation and mismanagement. The greatest threat to their survival is overuse, urban expansion, urban sprawl, mining, and pollution. Frequently, these systems and their functions are completely replaced by high rise buildings, residential development, cottages, tourist resorts, and recreation parks. The eventual consequence of such activities is the destruction of a fragile ecosystem.Tourism, in particular, has become an important activity with economic benefits that have resulted in severe environmental degradation of dunes. For example, hotels and houses are built directly on the dunes and trampling by people kills the stabilizing vegetation, thus exacerbating the process of sand movement and dune erosion. These changes in sediment supply and the regional sand budget produce extensive geomorphological and ecological damage with important economic consequences (Psuty, Chap. 2, this Vol.). As a result, there is the net loss of coastal dunes, their dynamics, and their natural biological diversity. Dune slacks have been similarly subjected to systematic alteration through overexploitation by grazing, hay making, and growth of crops.},

Although mosses are important dune stabilizers in temperate dunes, there are few studies focused on their response to burial by sand. In this study we examined the effects of burial by sand on 11 moss species that grow naturally on Lake Huron sand dunes and occur in a gradient of habitats from the foredunes along the shore to forested areas. Artificial burial treatments (sand depth of 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7~cm) were imposed under greenhouse and field conditions. We measured final plant cover and calculated the speed of emergence and an interpretive index (tolerance index) to compare burial responses among species by calculating a burial ratio which standardized the initial size of each species. In the greenhouse, Ceratodon purpureus and Ditrichum flexicaule recorded the highest mean speeds of emergence and Dicranum scoparium, Plagiothecium laetum, Dicranum flagellare and Brachythecium sp. 1 the lowest. In the field the trends were similar although the speed of emergence was much slower. Three types of response to burial were evident in plant cover: neutral, inhibition and stimulation. Although all eleven studied species were able to emerge from the different depths of burial, we observed that species colonizing areas with high sand mobility and deposition (C.~purpureus and D.~flexicaule) were the most tolerant and emerged from depths of up to 35~times their height. Species growing inland, at the base of trees (Dicranum scoparium, Brachythecium sp. 2, Plagiomnium cuspidatum and Dicranum flagellare) showed the least tolerance of burial.},

For example, seedling recruitment of dune species coincided with periods of high moisture availability and occurred in years with high well distributed rainfall. The seedlings exhibited rapid vertical elongation of roots, avoided moisture stress by leaf rolling, dense hair on leaves, fleshy cotyledonary leaves, and by growing in the shade of nurse plants. A certain proportion of seedlings of all species survived partial burial and showed stimulation of leaf growth, total leaf area, number of tillers and total dry matter. Seedlings of most species could not survive complete burial, however, some species did grow through the sand deposit by an increase in the number of nodes and length of internodes. Plants responded to salt spray by inhibition of seed germination, developing resistance, increase in leaf thickness and reduced uptake of Na and Cl ions. Several characters such as higher vigour of seedlings, larger seed size and seed polymorphism were also of adaptive significance to the species.},

  abstract = {Along coastal sand dunes, burial in sand is a regular event affecting the growth and survival of plant species. We conducted a field study to determine the effects of varying levels of experimental burial in sand on survival, growth, mode of shoot emergence, and biomass of Calamovilfa longifolia plants growing along the southeastern shoreline of Lake Huron. Results showed that as the burial depth increased, the density of emerging shoots significantly decreased until only a few shoots emerged from the 60 cm and none from the 80 cm burial depths. Although burial significantly reduced the above-ground biomass of plants per unit area, the above-ground biomass per emerged shoot increased with an increase in burial up to a depth of 40 cm. The shoot emergence was primarily due to an increase in the number of nodes and the elongation of internodes. Burial also significantly delayed the emergence of shoots from the sand deposit. The plant community dynamics and spatial distribution of species in dune systems may be directly explained on the basis of tolerance of species to the amount of burial in sand. For example, a species will be absent from microhabitats where the amount of sand accretion is greater than the threshold for its survival. This may be one of the reasons why species diversity is low on coastal sand dunes. Dans les dunes c\^oti\`eres, l'ensablement est un ph\'enom\`ene r\'ecurrent qui affecte la croissance et la survie des esp\`eces v\'eg\'etales. Cette \'etude a \'et\'e effectu\'ee sur le terrain dans le but de conna\^itre les effets de divers niveaux d'ensablement r\'ealis\'es de mani\`ere exp\'erimentale, sur la survie, la croissance et le mode d'\'emergence des tiges, ainsi que sur la biomasse des plants de Calamovilfa longifolia croissant sur la rive sud-est du lac Huron. Les r\'esultats indiquent qu'avec l'accroissement de la profondeur de l'ensablement, la densit\'e des tiges \'emergeant de la surface d\'ecro\^it de mani\`ere significative jusqu'\`a ce que seulement quelques tiges n'\'emergent \`a une profondeur d'ensablement de 60 cm, et plus aucune tige \`a plus de 80 cm. Bien que l'ensablement contribue \`a r\'eduire de mani\`ere significative la biomasse a\'erienne des plants par unit\'e de surface, la biomasse a\'erienne des tiges qui ont \'emerg\'e de la surface s'est accrue jusqu'\`a une profondeur d'ensablement de 40 cm.

  abstract = {More than 50 years ago it was proposed that zonation of major plant species on coastal dunes was determined by salt spray. Here, we argue against this hypothesis because (i) salt concentrations rarely exceed toxic levels; (ii) high precipitation in temperate latitudes washes the salt off the plants; (iii) major salt spray events occur in late autumn and winter when plants are dormant; and (iv) zonation also occurs on lacustrine dunes. Instead, we show evidence that zonation may be caused by burial because plant distribution was correlated with sand deposition and species were eliminated when burial exceeded their limits of tolerance, thus creating zones of different plant species. We conclude that in temperate regions (i) burial by sand may be among the most important factors in zonation, while salt spray may play a secondary role; and (ii) single environmental factors cannot be the determinants of a phenomenon as complex as species zonation.},

  abstract = {Mendoza-Gonz\'alez, G.; Luisa Mart\'inez, M., and Lithgow, D., 2014. Biological flora of coastal dunes and wetlands: Canavalia rosea (Sw.) DC. The genus Canavalia includes 60 species, of which 37 are found in the Neotropics. One of the most common members of this genus is Canavalia rosea. In this paper, we present a compilation of the ecological, physiological, and geomorphological biology of this pantropical beach and coastal dune species that will serve as a basis for scientists and managers interested in the species. This legume (Fabaceae) is a perennial trailing vine that grows on five continents and is also found on many islands. The leaves are compound, and the leaflets are roughly circular in shape, with an entire margin and a short petiole. The flowers are small, pink-purple, in racemes and range from 1 to 3 cm in diameter. Blooming takes place with greatest intensity between May and September, although sporadic racemes can be found throughout the year. Fruits are large, 7\textendash 12 cm long, with marbled brown dormant seeds. The root is monopodic and presents a mycorrhizal association. It is a successful colonizer of tropical shorelines due to the dispersal of its seeds by ocean currents and a high tolerance to salt spray, burial, low-nutrient substrates, and high temperature. The species is an important sand colonizer and plays a significant role in the geomorphology of beaches and frontal dunes. The species often covers large areas and forms a relatively continuous mat that stabilizes the sandy substrate in which it grows. The leaves, stems, and seeds have many nutritional and medicinal uses due to their high protein content and active bactericidal ingredients. El g\'enero Canavalia incluye 60 especies de las cuales 37 se encuentran en la regi\'on Neotropical. Uno de los miembros m\'as extendidos del g\'enero es Canavalia rosea. En este trabajo presentamos una recopilaci\'on de la literatura, que no ha sido reunida previamente sobre la biolog\'ia de esta especie, la cual es importante debido a su amplia distribuci\'on en el mundo. Esta leguminosa (Fabaceae) posee una distribuci\'on pantropical en las playas arenosas y dunas frontales de los cinco continentes y tiene la habilidad de dispersarse por corrientes marinas. C. rosea posee ramas que pueden medir m\'as de ocho metros de largo, con hojas compuestas y foliolos orbiculares con margen entero y tallo corto. Las inflorescencias son de color rosado o p\'urpura. La floraci\'on ocurre entre mayo y septiembre con mayor intensidad, aunque puede ser espor\'adica durante el resto del a\~no. Los frutos son vainas de 7\textendash 12 cm de largo con semillas latentes, redondas y de color caf\'e. La ra\'iz es profunda, monop\'odica y posee asociaciones micorr\'icicas. Es una colonizadora exitosa de las costas tropicales gracias a su capacidad de dispersi\'on a larga distancia por medio de las corrientes marinas y a su alta tolerancia al spray salino, al enterramiento y a sustratos con altas temperaturas y bajas cantidades de nutrientes. Esta colonizadora desempe\~na un papel muy importante en la geomorfolog\'ia de las playas y dunas frontales ya que es capaz de cubrir grandes \'areas y formar tapetes casi continuos que ayudan a fijar la arena y mantienen el sustrato aglutinado. Adem\'as, las hojas, tallos y semillas tienen m\'ultiples usos alimenticios y medicinales por su alto contenido en prote\'inas y principios bactericidas activos.},

  abstract = {Vegetated coastal dunes have the capacity to keep up with sea-level rise by accumulating and stabilizing wind-blown sand. In Europe, this is attributed to marram grass (Ammophila arenaria), a coastal grass species that combines two unique advantages for dune-building: (1) a very high tolerance to burial by wind-blown sand, and (2) more vigorous growth due to positive feedback to sand burial. However, while these vegetation characteristics have been demonstrated, observational data has not been used to model a function to describe the growth response of Ammophila to sand burial. Studies that model coastal dune development by incorporating positive feedback, as a result, may be hampered by growth functions that are unvalidated against field data. Therefore, this study aims to parameterize an empirical relationship to model the growth response of Ammophila to burial by wind-blown sand. A coastal foredune along a nourished beach in the Netherlands was monitored from April 2015 to April 2016. High-resolution geospatial data was acquired using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Growth response of Ammophila, expressed by changes in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({$\Delta$} NDVI) and vegetation cover ({$\Delta$} Cover), is related to a sand burial gradient by fitting a Gaussian function using nonlinear quantile regression. The regression curves indicate an optimal burial rate for Ammophila of 0.31m of sand per growing season, and suggest (by extrapolation of the data) a maximum burial tolerance for Ammophila between 0.78 (for {$\Delta$} Cover) and 0.96m (for {$\Delta$} NDVI) of sand per growing season. These findings are advantageous to coastal management: maximizing the potential of Ammophila to develop dunes maximizes the potential of coastal dunes to provide coastal safety.},

However, the survival and growth responses of shrubs to sand burial remain poorly understood. The survival rate and seedling height of two shrubs (Artemisia halodendron and Lespedeza davurica) along with the soil properties under different burial depths were examined in order to reveal the causing ecophysiological attributes of sand burial on shrubs in the desertified region. It was found that A. halodendron can survive a burial depth of 6~cm greater than its seedling height, which is a dominant shrub in mobile dunes with intense burial, whereas a burial depth equivalent to three fourths of its seedling height is detrimental to L. davurica, which is dominant in fixed dunes with less burial. The reasons for the shrub death under sand burial were associated with the physical barrier to vertical growth and the reduction in photosynthetic area. In conclusion, A. halodendron can facilitate the stabilization of mobile dunes because of their high tolerance to the frequent and intensive sand burial, while L. davurica can be beneficial for the recovery process because of their higher survival rates under shallow burial following restoration of mobile dunes.},

By expanding clonally, landscape-forming plants can colonize bare unmodified environments and stimulate vegetation\textendash landform feedback interactions. Yet, to what degree these plants rely on clonal integration for overcoming physical stress during biogeomorphological succession remains unknown. Here, we investigated the importance of clonal integration and resource availability on the resilience of two European beach grasses (i.e. Elytrigia juncea and Ammophila arenaria) over a natural biogeomorphic dune gradient from beach (unmodified system) to foredune (biologically modified system). We found plant resilience, as measured by its ability to recover and expand following disturbance (i.e. plant clipping), to be independent on the presence of rhizomal connections between plant parts. Instead, resource availability over the gradient largely determined plant resilience. The pioneer species, Elytrigia, demonstrated a high resilience to physical stress, independent of its position on the biogeomorphic gradient (beach or embryonic dune). In contrast, the later successional species (Ammophila) proved to be highly resilient on the lower end of its distribution (embryonic dune), but it did not fully recover on the foredunes, most likely as a result of nutrient deprivation. We argue that in homogenously resource-poor environments as our beach system, overall resource availability, instead of translocation through a clonal network, determines the resilience of plant species. Hence, the formation of high coastal dunes may increase the resistance of beach grasses to the physical stresses of coastal flooding, but the reduced marine nutrient input may negatively affect the resilience of plants.},

  abstract = {Coastal dunes provide important ecosystem services and are susceptible to human disturbance such as vehicle traffic and human trampling. Notwithstanding, on several Australian beaches dunes serves as camping areas, where camping sites are located on the primary dunes landwards of the foredunes. Because these activities have the potential to impact on the biota of the foredunes directly adjoining the camping zones, sustainable management of dunes for multiple uses requires that putative impacts are identified. Consequently, we quantified: (1) effects of dune camping on the vegetation in the foredunes abutting the camping zones, (2) ghost crab (Ocypode cordimana) abundance, distribution, body size, and body condition as biological indicators of human stressors, and (3) the degree to which habitat attributes are correlated with ghost crab abundance. Two percent of the foredune surface was disturbed by human activity (vehicle tracks, trampling, dog prints, litter). Camping in the primary dunes had some minor effects on the vegetation of the foredunes, but widespread changes in plant assemblages were not detected. Ghost crabs were attracted to camp sites, significantly changing their distribution across the dune field and increasing their body condition near camp sites\textemdash presumably a trophic subsidy from food scraps. Except for vegetation height which had a positive influence on crab density, there were no other strong and consistent predictors of ghost crab density either in terms of physical habitat attributes (e.g. dune width and height) or vegetation characteristics (e.g. plant cover, diversity). Because coastal managers must increasingly reconcile multiple uses of the environment with its protection, robust data on the type, extent and magnitude of impacts are critical to formulate efficient management strategies for dunes. Monitoring the efficacy of such strategies requires robust indicators, and we show that ghost crabs may be good candidate species for this.},

Growth analyses and measurements of photosynthesis were carried after the plants had been uncovered., \textbullet{} Key Results All the plants survived partial burial, but about 30 \% and 80 \% of the seedlings died as a result of the 100 \% and 133 \% sand burial treatments, respectively. The numbers of newly produced leaves and branches, and the height of the stems of the seedlings in the 33 \% and 67 \% burial treatments during the period of the experiment were significantly greater than those in the control. Furthermore, net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and water use efficiency were also elevated by the partial burial, but not affected by burial time. This might be attributed to the increased root length, which improved water acquisition. The biomass and biomass allocation of the seedlings were significantly changed by the burial treatments and burial times. The biomass was enhanced by partial burial but was reduced by complete burial at each burial time. However, the biomass allocation was not significantly changed by the 33 \% and 67 \% sand burial treatments 2 or 4 weeks following the burial., \textbullet{} Conclusions Ulmus pumila was shown to be tolerant to partial sand burial, but must be protected from complete burial.},

  abstract = {Many overlapping mechanisms have been proposed to control horizontal seaward expansion of marshes and rates of elevation change that are associated with it. Key questions to resolve are: i) whether simple geomorphological conditions such as elevation are a reliable predictor of marsh expansion rates; ii) whether there are seasonal vegetation-induced effects on elevation change (both, increase and decrease of elevation); and iii) how steep the spatial gradient of elevation change is from the bare tidal flat into the vegetated marsh? These questions have been addressed with a two-scale study approach performed on two contrastingly wave-exposed marshes in the Scheldt Estuary (SW Netherlands and N Belgium) where Scirpus maritimus is the dominant pioneer species. On the one hand, we investigated the relations between large-scale, geomorphological parameters (elevation, slope) and clonal marsh expansion rates at both sites. On the other hand, we performed a small-scale monthly field monitoring over two years at the same two marshes where we investigated the relations between spatio-temporal variations in vertical elevation change and spatio-temporal variations in vegetation properties along cross-shore transects. We found that at the sheltered site, clonal expansion rates are almost twice as high as at the exposed site. Furthermore, expansion rates at the sheltered site related well to elevation. At the exposed site, this relation was less strong as wave exposure might cause a dominant disturbance. Moreover, we found clear seasonal elevation change patterns that closely followed the seasonal vegetation cycle, with prevailing increase in elevation in summer when above-ground biomass was maximal and decrease in elevation in winter when plant shoots had largely decayed. Especially at the exposed site, the presence of vegetation has a positive effect on increase in elevation within the marsh. Finally, our results show that clonal marsh expansion succeeded at elevations for which previous studies at the same locations showed that individual shoots could not establish, emphasising the importance of clonal integration for both survival and lateral expansion in disturbance-driven ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Sand burial is an important environmental disturbance which determines seed germination, plant establishment, and plant fitness in sand dune ecosystems. But the critical importance of sand burial for seedling establishment of desert shrubs is rarely explored. We investigated the effects of sand burial at different regimes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 cm, the main depths of soil seed bank) on the seedling emergence, growth and survival rate of three dominant desert shrubs (Calligonum mongolicum, Nitraria sphaerocarpa and Haloxylon ammodendron) for ecosystem restoration in sand dunes of northwestern China. The results indicated that shallow burial improved the seedling emergence and the subsequent seedling survival rate for the initial establishment period. The optimal burial depths were 2, 4 and 5 cm for H. ammodendron, N. sphaerocarpa and C. mongolicum, respectively; this difference in optimal burial depth may account for observed decreased regeneration of H. ammodendron as compared to the other two species. Beyond the optimal depths, we found that sand burial prevented seedling emergence for H. ammodendron and N. sphaerocarpa. Only a small proportion of seedlings can emerged from deep burial depth by increasing seedling biomass allocation to blow-ground stem. However, after emergence deep sand burial stimulated growth rate of emerged seedlings, increased the seedling vigor and promoted the seedling establishment. We suggest that sand burial could affect plant regeneration and potentially leaded to shift in species composition. Choice of suitable species for ecosystem restoration needs to account for its ability in term of seed germination and plant establishment/regeneration to adapt to disturbance of sand burial.},

  abstract = {Messerschmidia sibirica Linn,Siberian sea rosemary,may be useful in the restoration and protection of sand dunes.We explored its ability to withstand varying levels of sand burial in the Yan Tai coastal dune in the spring and summer of 2009 and 2010.Four levels of sand burial treatments were set up: no-sand burial(control),light sand burial(1/3 of plant height),moderate sand burial(2/3 of plant height) and severe sand burial(plant fully covered by sand).Changes in soil temperature,soil moisture,fresh weight(FW),dry weight(DW),relative plant height,plasma membrane permeability,MDA content,osmotic regulation,and activity of antioxidant enzymes in the leaves of plants in different levels of sand burial were investigated to elucidate the strategies used to maintain physiological and biochemical processes during growth in the different environments.Soil temperatures below sand decreased while soil water content increased with increasing levels of sand burial.Plants in light and moderate sand burials were taller than controls.In individual plants,the FW and DW of leaves above sand increased while FW and DW of leaves below sand decreased.On the 5th day after sand burial,the leaves of whole plants in each of the three levels of sand burial had lower membrane permeability,MDA and proline contents and higher levels of activities of SOD and CAT than controls.Also,in individual plants,membrane permeability,MDA and proline contents,and activities of SOD and CAT in the leaves below sand were lower than in leaves above sand.The decrease in these physiological indicators was therefore correlated with increases in soil moisture and lower soil temperatures.Leaves above sand appeared to suffer from stronger ground thermal radiation,drought stress,and high temperature. These findings suggest that under light and moderate sand burial,antioxidant enzymes and proline play an important physiological regulating role in retarding lipid peroxidation and protect the leaves above sand,allowing them to grow rapidly and helping the plant avoid further sand burial.Moreover,under severe sand burial,although darkness and low oxygen limit photosynthesis and respiration of the buried leaves,those leaves can keep more nutrients to transfer to the apex of the shoot to make it grow and emerge above sand.Our results confirm that Messerschmidia sibirica Linn has a high resistance to even severe sand burial and uncovers some of the physiological strategies employed in this resistance.Thus it may be a very suitable plant for vegetation restoration,sand fixation,and protecting beaches in coastal dunes.},

  abstract = {Observations of experimental dunes made over a period of nine years indicate differences in utilizing three different dune species along the North Carolina coast and in the type of dunes produced by them.Ammophila is superior in ease of establishment and rate of sand accumulation but is shortlived. It produces a gently sloping dune.Uniola is difficult to propagate but is an excellent dune builder and eventually dominates the foredune. Grown alone, it produces a steep dune front.Panicum is an excellent companion plant to bothAmmophila andUniola. It is easy to propagate, relatively free of pests and produces dunes intermediate in shape, betweenAmmophila andUniola. Plantings of mixtures of two or more of these species should greatly improve long-term dune stability compared with either planted alone.},

Field studies were conducted to determine the effects of burial in sand on net CO\textsubscript{2} uptake, water potential and leaf morphology of two grasses, the C\textsubscript{3}, Ammophila breviligulata and the C\textsubscript{4}, Calamovilfa longifolia. 2. Buried plants of both species exhibited higher net photosynthetic rates than controls. However, the increase in net CO\textsubscript{2} uptake was much greater in A. breviligulata than in C. longifolia. 3. At the same burial depth, C. longifolia usually maintained a greater net photosynthetic rate than A. breviligulata. 4. Sand accretion did not influence the water potential of leaves but resulted in a slight increase (not significant) in leaf thickness of A. breviligulata but a significant increase in leaf thickness of C. longifolia. 5. A significant increase was also recorded in the number of bundle sheath cells of C. longifolia in response to sand accretion.},

  abstract = {Adjustments to the allocation of aboveground biomass allocation are an important component of the adaptive strategies of plant growth. Plants can modify their biomass allocation patterns to adapt to various environmental conditions. Sandy areas vary widely in topography, generating a diversity of microenvironments. However, knowledge about biomass allocation patterns of shrubs in different microtopographic areas in sandy habitats remains limited. Moreover, most studies have not considered the effect of age on plant biomass allocation responses to habitat differences. In August 2017, we measured the age, height, ground-level diameter, and leaf and stem matter of Salix psammophila, a species that overwhelmingly dominates a wide range of habitats in China. Biomass allocation patterns (leaf vs. stem biomass, biomass vs. diameter) were compared between two sandy vegetation environments in an area of the Mu Us Sandy Land. The results indicated that the rate of biomass accumulation decreased with age and, as shoots aged, they tended to allocate more biomass to stems, which provide support and transport functions, than to leaves (assimilatory organs). Soil moisture was the main environmental factor influencing the allocation strategy of S. psammophila. Favorable moisture habitats increased the overall biomass accumulation rate by promoting the allocation of biomass to leaf tissue. Habitat and age had an interactive effect on biomass accumulation and allocation, and larger plants were more likely to suffer from resource limitation. This study contributes to a better understanding of the life-history strategies of shrubs under frequently changing sandy conditions, which can contribute to efforts in vegetation recovery management.},
